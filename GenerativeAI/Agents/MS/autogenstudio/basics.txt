we can beat a better LLM models using a small LLM models using Agents.


1)Building blocks of agents.

2)Installation of Agents.

3) Real world use case of agents.

What are agents?
in autogen , An agent is having skills.

1) Skills.

        Skills are nothing but functions , serves for a specific purpose. it has an inputs and output

        Inputs --> Skills --> Outputs     |     Python Functions , serves a specific purpose.
                                        |  
        Example

        Prompt --> Skills --> Image saved Locally

2) Models.

        Open source Models or Closed Source Models.

3) Agents.

it contains both Skills and Models. it takes Inputs from the user or Other agents, and using the Skills and models 
talk to eaxh other and gives an Output requested by the user or the agent.

            Input

        Skills  <-->    Models          Agents
            
            Output

4) Work Flows
How are these work flows being structured. That means how are these agents are going to talk to eachother, 
in order  to give us the required outputs. IT is also called as Conversational Patterns and behaviours.

Converstational Behaviour / Patterns

    1) Two - Agent Chats. -> Two agents talking to each other.
    2) Sequential Chats. -> Multiple sequence of two agents talking to each other. 
                            And the conversations are talking to each other.and then during the Chats
                            all the conversations are being fed to the each other , we call it as memory.
                            This pattern is useful for Complex task that can be broken down into independent sub-tasks.

    3) Group Chat. -> Group chat Manager or --> Agent A
                        Orchestrator            Agent B
                                                Agent C
                                                Agent D   

                    The group chat Manager is going to tell or choose the Agents, who is going to chat or going to do the task.

    4) Nested Chat. -> it is a combination of all these patterns.
